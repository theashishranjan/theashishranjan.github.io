I started wriitng code at the age 11 and the credit goes to my father who for some reason thought of buying a computer instead of TV for our house. Since then I don't just write code rather I try and solve all my problems though code.

I spent majority of my college years working on embedded systems, sensors(mainly MEMS) and connecting those to the internet. In short I was doing IOT(internet of things) before it was cool and would'd like to consider myself very well experinced with Indoor Navigation Systems and Bluetoth Low Energy. I have worked professionally as a full stack web engineer but deep down I am not that happy while writing frontend.

I consider myself very good at explaning techinal thing to non technical crowd and this has enabled me help a lot of non-tech background startup founders with their techincal setup.

Apart from professional jobs listed on LinkedIn, I am also a selected freelance member of [Gigster](http://www.gigster.com) community and was one of the first 400 members of this amazing group.

Markdown is my goto writing style and trailing white spaces get on my nerves!
